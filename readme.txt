index.html 

This page should display a simple design with the widgets floating up and down.
Widgets should not pass the section piece with text.
Text should be in a boxed section and introduce the site and the purpose of the site.
Top of the page should display a navigation bar, hovering over other nav buttons should change 
the color of the button. Clicking the nav buttons will not work in this current build, but will in final build.
At the bottom of the page, there is a footer panel that should include my email if there are problems,
the date the site was updated, and the purpose of the site once more.

NOTE: Work Page has been removed temporary due to lack of content

style.css
The stylesheet should provide for everything needed for the html to look as described above.
The stylesheet is responsible for the background color, text color, any fonts, text 
sizes, and all customization. This includes the navigation bar's design and animations. 
This stylesheet is required for every HTML document included in the folder.
